# Web Scraper API Project

## Project Overview
Create a Python web scraping API that can extract data from websites and provide both REST API and command-line interfaces. This project should demonstrate more complex coding patterns and edge cases for real-time linting validation.

## Core Features

### 1. Web Scraping Engine
- Support multiple scraping strategies (BeautifulSoup, Selenium, requests)
- Handle JavaScript-rendered content
- Implement rate limiting and retry logic
- Support for custom headers and proxies

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Export to multiple formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
- Data validation and schema enforcement
- Duplicate detection and filtering

### 3. REST API Interface
- FastAPI-based HTTP server
- Asynchronous request handling
- Input validation with Pydantic models
- OpenAPI documentation generation
- Authentication and rate limiting

### 4. Command Line Interface
- Rich CLI with progress bars and colored output
- Configuration file support (YAML/JSON)
- Batch processing capabilities
- Logging and error reporting

### 5. Database Integration
- SQLite for caching scraped data
- Database migrations and schema versioning
- Query optimization and indexing
- Connection pooling

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Dependency injection for testability
- Configuration management with environment variables
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Quality Standards
- Type hints throughout the codebase
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Code coverage > 80%
- Proper documentation with docstrings
- Security best practices (input sanitization, SQL injection prevention)

### Performance
- Async/await for concurrent operations
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Memory-efficient data processing

## Expected Challenges for Linting
This project will test the real-time linting system with:
- Complex async/await patterns
- Database connection management
- File I/O operations
- Error handling patterns
- Type annotation complexity
- Security vulnerabilities (injection attacks, unsafe deserialization)
- Performance anti-patterns
- Code complexity metrics

## Deliverables
1. Core scraping engine with multiple adapters
2. FastAPI REST API with full OpenAPI spec
3. CLI tool with rich user interface
4. Database layer with migrations
5. Comprehensive test suite
6. Configuration and deployment documentation

This project represents a realistic medium-complexity application that will thoroughly test SoloPilot's real-time linting, self-correction, and code generation capabilities.
