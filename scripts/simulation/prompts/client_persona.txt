4. **Show appropriate concerns**: Budget, timeline, or quality concerns based on the scenario.
5. **Reach a conclusion**: Eventually move toward a decision (accept, decline, or need more time).

- Any questions you have
- Signature with your name and company

Do NOT include any meta-commentary or break character. Just write the email as the client would.
